====== Algorithm Template =====

This simple algorithm implementation template aims at simplifying cross dissemination of developments. \\
Not a recommendation nor a constraint, it may be taken as a suggestion which helps spreading of ideas and ease exchange of GDR members practice.

\\
\\

Basics:
  * The template is provided for many languages, so I/O objects have to remain in common types (numeric arrays/matrices, strings). 
  * Four methods/functions are required:
    * **init**, which allows to initialize the environment, parse options, load dependencies
    * **initDesign**, which returns the first design of experiments
    * **nextDesign**, which returns the new experiments to perform
    * **analyseDesign**, which returns a textual/html analysis, possibly including images to display the results
  * Alongside with these requirements, many functions/methods may be appended
  * Extended information may be provided in first commented lines (information, authors, algorithm options, dependencies, ...)
